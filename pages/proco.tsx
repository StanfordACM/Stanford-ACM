          Students compete in teams of up to three to compete in solving
          algorithmic problems. The contest will last 3 hours and consist of 9 -
          15 unweighted problems.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          The contest is also split between two separate divisions: Novice and
          Advanced. The problem set will be shared for both divisions, however,
          final team placements and prizes will be determined within each
          division.

          <strong>
            Q: How much programming experience do I need to compete?
          </strong>
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          A: Most competitors will have had at least one year of programming
          experience. You will need to know how to manipulate integers, strings
          and arrays. It is not necessary to know advanced data structures
          (lists, sets, maps, stacks, queues, trees), though you may find this
          knowledge helpful. If we introduce a concept that you are not expected
          to know, we will explain it thoroughly in the problem description.

        <Paragraph>
          <strong>Q: What division should I be in? </strong>
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          A: The Novice division is designed for first-timers and competitors
          with less than two years of programming experience. The Advanced
          division is designed for returning competitors and competitors with at
          least two years of programming experience, or who have previously
          competed in ProCo.

        <Paragraph>
          <strong>
            Q: Is there an advantage to coding in a particular language?
          </strong>
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          A: No. Each language has pros and cons, and you should choose the
          language you are most comfortable with. In general, we have written
          the problems carefully so that language-specific features will not
          give anyone an unfair advantage.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          <strong>Q: How will input and output work with my IDE? </strong>
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          A: This depends on the language and software package you&apos;re
          using.
        </Paragraph>
        <ul>
          <li>
            C and C++ programs run from the console and take input and output
            from the console.
          </li>
          <li>
            Java with Eclipse: Input and output can be passed through the
            Console window.
          </li>
          <li>
            Java with JCreator: By default, JCreator 4 captures output. You can
            pass input by typing directly into General Output window. You can
            also bring up the console by going to Configure &gt; Options &gt;
            JDK Tools &gt; Run Application &gt; Edit and unchecking Capture
            output.
          </li>
          <li>
            Python 3 with IDLE: The console is built into the scripting
            environment.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <Paragraph>
          <strong>
            Q: Will all the input be in one terminal entry, or will each line be
            separate?
          </strong>
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          A: Each problem has its own input format. For some problems, the input
          will be a single integer, for other problems, the input will consist
          of multiple lines. We have designed the problems such that parsing the
          input will be as simple as possible.

        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
