          ACMLab is Stanford&apos;s premier machine learning club. Its goal is
          to teach anyone with basic CS experience machine learning. After an
          intensive ramp-up workshop in the fall, members work on publishing
          papers at top ML conferences and workshops. We have published 6
          workshop papers so far at top conferences and workshops such as ACL
          and ICLR. Alumni have gone on to Google AI, Stanford ML Group,
          Stanford NLP Group, and VMWare.
